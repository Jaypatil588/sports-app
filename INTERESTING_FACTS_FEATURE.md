## 💡 Best Practices

### For Better Facts

**Good Queries:**

```

**Results in Better Facts:**
- More specific = More interesting fact
- Historical queries = Rich historical context
- Comparison queries = Unique insights

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Fact Not Appearing?

**Possible Reasons:**
1. AI didn't generate a fact (rare)
2. Query too vague
3. No interesting context available
4. API error

**Solution:**
- Try a more specific query
- Search for well-known players/teams
- Include historical context

### Fact Too Long?

**Current Design:**
- Text wraps automatically

**If Needed:**
Backend can be adjusted to limit fact length in prompt.

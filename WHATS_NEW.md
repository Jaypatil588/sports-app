## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Writing Good Queries

**Good Queries** ✅:
- "Virat Kohli IPL 2023 stats"
- "Real Madrid Champions League wins"
- "Serena Williams Grand Slam titles"
- "LeBron James career points"

**Could Be Better** ⚠️:
- "Player stats" (too vague)
- "Who won?" (missing context)
- "Best team" (subjective)

### Getting the Best Data

1. **Be Specific**: Include player/team names and years
2. **Use Suggestions**: Popular searches are pre-tested
3. **Try Variations**: If one query doesn't work, rephrase it
4. **Include Context**: Tournaments, seasons, competitions

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **AI Knowledge Cutoff**: Some very recent data (last few weeks) might not be available
2. **Approximate Data**: When exact numbers aren't available, AI provides approximations
3. **Rate Limits**: Gemini API has usage limits (check your API quota)
